Hi! I'm Farzan S, and I just wrapped up a Masters in Management Analytics from Wilfrid Laurier University. 
I learned how to write SQL/noSQL queries, build ML models and use R and python for analytical purposes, so I thought I'd build a Github to showcase some of the projects I've worked on. 
Disclaimer: All projects use publicly available datasets primarily taken from Kaggle. Shoutout to the original creators!
